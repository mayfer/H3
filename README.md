# Code & model release

You can find model weights on the Hugging Face Hub here (under "Files and Versions" for each model):
* [125M](https://huggingface.co/danfu09/H3-125M)
* [355M](https://huggingface.co/danfu09/H3-355M)
* [1.3B](https://huggingface.co/danfu09/H3-1.3B)
* [2.7B](https://huggingface.co/danfu09/H3-2.7B)

An example of how to load the weights is given in `benchmarks/benchmark_generation.py`.
More examples coming soon!
